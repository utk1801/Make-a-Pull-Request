> WhoAmI ?? :star: :boy:
I'm a pro learner open to explore new career paths. I am an active Tech Community Member ,  a GDG(Google's Developer  Group) Community Member since my college years. I love exploring the works of Open Source community, and gain knowledge and develop ideas on my own. I like to code, read, write, draw and dream to travel a lot! 

I work on Java and Python majorly, with web development being next. Artificial intelligence fascinates me and I hope to work on same in future. Apart from that, I contribute to open-source

I like interacting with nice people but at the same time am a little introvert. Also, I like to encourage people. I love watching Sci/Fi,Thriller movies. 

That’s enough for here! I’m like recursion, to understand me, you need to understand me!
